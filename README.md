# Deck of Cards
Simple playing cards demos with both 2D and 3D versions for web.
- A deck of playing cards built in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
- Two versions: a lightweight 2D approach and a Three.js 3D approach.
- Suitable as a starter for card games, UI experiments, or graphics demos.

## Demos
- https://jsplayingcards.netlify.app/
- `basic/basic.html`: 2D deck built with Unicode characters, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (~16 KB).
- `threejs_version/3jsdeck.html`: 3D deck using Three.js card meshes (~70 KB).

## Launch page
- `index.html` is the landing page that links to the demos.

## Run locally

- The Three.js demo should be served from a local host (e.g. `http://localhost`) to load correctly.

## Project layout
