# Deck of Cards
100% JavaScript playing cards demos with both 2D and 3D versions.
## Why this is useful
- Learn how to render playing cards in pure HTML/CSS/JS.
- Compare a lightweight 2D approach with a Three.js 3D approach.
- Use as a starter for card games, UI experiments, or graphics demos.

## Demos
- `basic/basic.html`: 2D deck built with Unicode characters, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (~16 KB).
- `threejs_version/3jsdeck.html`: 3D deck using Three.js card meshes (~70 KB).

## Launch page
- `index.html` is the landing page that links to the demos.

## Run locally
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- The Three.js demo should be served from a local host (e.g. `http://localhost`) to load correctly.

## Project layout
- `basic/`: 2D Unicode-based implementation.
- `threejs_version/`: Three.js-based implementation.
